Dear Harry and David, do the following works to review your github skills.

1. Clone this repository to your local drives.
2. Open the file `test.c`, edit the function `hello_david` and `hello_harry`
   respectively, to print a line of `Hello github, from ` and then your 
   name.
3. Compile the source file and output the result to out_*yourname*.txt,
   then add this file to the repository. 
4. Commit and push all the result back. 

__NOTE:__ Do not alter others' code and do not add binary files to the 
repository (which can be done using `.gitignore` file).
